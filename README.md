# NaturalSelection
Simulation of a natural selection model

Next steps:
- Save the results on the avg quantities and the behaviour of the population, making also possible to load a previous state and keep working with it;
- Introduce the dinamic of the size, making the big agents able to eat the smaller ones;
- Add descriptions all around the code;
- Improve the visualization (maybe using another library).
